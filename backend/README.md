# MathGen

MathGen is a full stack application that allows users to select a math subject, and a topic within that subject. It will then generate 10 random problems and display them to the user. The user then solves the problem and when they are ready to check their answer they may either press on the problem or on the answer icon and a dialog will appear with the correct answer. It consists of a Node.js backend server that communicates with OpenAI through the OpenAI Api for generating the problems based on the user's selections. And the frontend is built using Flutter.
